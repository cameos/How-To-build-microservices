# How-To-build-microservices

Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices.
Some applications are still monolithic and developers should move away from monolithic in favor of microservices architecture.
The beautify of these microservices is that each service runs a unique process and they communicate through a ligh weight mechanisms, the problem with monolithic application is that they are build as single unit and they are tied to one another.
Microservices gives and allow developers the capabilities to work on individual components with in the application, each component is not tied to another component, these components will communicate via interfaces reducing the need for synchronized updates so that each component’s team can work on their own best schedule. Scalability is great enabled for a wide range of platforms and devices as web, mobile and IoT backend can be deployed, fixed, and updated independently of each other.
